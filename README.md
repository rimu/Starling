# ⋰⋱ Starling (v0.0.5)

> The simplest way to run your own fediverse server: no database, no workers, no DevOps.

- Runs on shared hosting
- No MySQL or PostgreSQL required (uses SQLite)
- No background workers or cron jobs
- Deploy like a simple PHP app

Starling is a lightweight ActivityPub server built with PHP and SQLite, designed to run on shared hosting and low-resource environments. It is built for small, independent instances that want to stay simple: PHP, SQLite, a Mastodon-compatible API, and built-in web and admin interfaces.

Inspired by starling murmurations: decentralized, leaderless, and shaped by nearby connection.

An idea by Domingos Faria.

## Highlights

- ActivityPub federation for posts, follows, replies, likes, and boosts
- Mastodon-compatible API surface
- Built-in web client and admin panel
- SQLite storage for straightforward deployment
- No heavy external dependencies such as dedicated cron jobs or extra worker services
- Designed to run comfortably on typical shared hosting and small VPS hosts.

## Why Starling?

Starling aims to keep the fediverse approachable.

It favors a small stack, simple deployment, and practical compatibility over heavy infrastructure. The goal is not to be the biggest platform, but to make it easy to run a personal or community server that can still speak to the wider network without depending on a large service stack.

## Fediverse Compatibility

Starling speaks ActivityPub and can interact with platforms such as:

- Mastodon
- GoToSocial
- Misskey
- Pleroma
- PixelFed
- other ActivityPub-compatible servers

Tested clients so far include Ivory, Mastodon iOS, Elk, Phanpy, Fedicat, MastoBlaster, and IceCubes.

## What You Can Do

- publish posts and replies
- follow local and remote account's
- like, boost, bookmark, lists, and filter content
- use Mastodon-compatible clients and web apps
- manage an instance with admin tools for federation, relays, maintenance, and delivery queues

## Requirements

- PHP 8.2 or newer with SQLite support

Starling runs on a minimal PHP stack and is compatible with typical LAMP-style hosting environments (no MySQL required). This makes it suitable for shared hosting, low-cost hosting, small VPS, or personal instances.

## Quick Start

1. Copy the project to your server.
2. Open `/install` and complete the installer.
3. Open `/admin` for general settings and instance operation.

## Project Status

Starling is already usable and feature-rich, but it is still a compact project with an intentionally simple architecture.

It is best suited to small instances, experiments, and independent deployments that value simplicity over large-scale operational complexity.
